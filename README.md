# Countdown!

Inspired by [this](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1002697506457307/permalink/1004551372938587/?comment_id=1004551872938537&offset=0&total_comments=12&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R1%22%7D) quote, how many things would I have to do per day to finish before X date?

Right now it's set to our anual Quidditch World Cup retreat, but it'll be extensible later.

It'll also probably change format to be "In fact, you'd have to VERB X ITEMs per day to finish before then!"

This will be a breaking change.
